    <p>1.1 Introduction:</p>
    <p>Welcome to the Smart Token System. It is the faster and most convenient way to reserve the tokens used in different organizations like Government Offices, Banks, and Hospitals. Login, navigate and find out yourselves and if time permits leave your valuable feedback. Customers may view the different token facilities provided by this website and may book the tokens used in different organizations in Chitwan. When a visitor decides to book a token, they may choose the different organizations' visit date and time. After the booking, they get the PDF of that page that may be needed in their use of visiting the Organization. You need to register a new user whenever you have visited our site, and it will be stored in our database permanently, and you can book your token at any time you want with this username and password. The smart token booking project basically manages the token booking process in an organization, providing an interface to the user to book tokens in a much easier way. The system proceeds through a sequence of well-designed forms provided with validations to ensure consistency, reliability, and most importantly correctness of information fed into the database. The website works by using a database containing a list of organizations.</p>

    <p>1.2 Problem Statement:</p>
    <p>The main problem of todayâ€™s scenario is that we must stay in line for services provided by different organizations, especially in banks, hospitals, and government offices. We must spend a day or our special time on simple processes due to which our other works can be affected in our daily lives. Some of the problem statements for the smart token system are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How can we design a system that allows users to purchase and use tokens to access certain services or features on a website or application?</li>
      <li>How can we ensure that the token store is secure and can handle a large volume of transactions?</li>
      <li>How can we track and manage users' token balances and transaction history in a way that is efficient and easy to use?</li>
      <li>How can we protect against fraud and unauthorized access to the system, while still making it easy for users to access their accounts and use their tokens?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>1.3 Objectives:</p>
<p>The main objective of this project is to reduce the time loss of a person and increase their productivity, which can be beneficial for them in the future. A person can reserve the seat or quota available at a particular date and time electronically, wherever they are and in a convenient way. The reservation process is simple: a person has to first register on the site during the first visit, and that information will be stored in the database for future use. After signing up, a person can reserve the quota available for their convenient time without even going to those offices. After the reservation, a PDF is provided that can be shown at the time of entry to those particular offices. The reservation can be canceled at any time if not necessary or if there are any changes in the person's plans.</p>

<p>Another main goal of this project is to cater to user interests. The goal is to create a website that provides services like online token booking for various organizations such as banks.</p>

<p>1.4 Scope and Limitation:</p>
<p>Scope:</p>
<p>The Smart Token System can provide customers with a more convenient experience as they can book a time slot online rather than having to visit the service location in person. It also reduces wait times by allowing customers to reserve their place in line remotely without physically waiting in a queue.</p>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is reliant on technology, which can be subject to malfunctions or other types of issues that may disrupt service delivery.</li>
  <li>There is no notification system implemented into the website as of now. Users must manually open the website to not miss out on anything.</li>
  <li>This webpage cannot open without internet access.</li>
</ul>
